                <p>
                    Camp Zodiac is inspired by a graphic design project that was dropped due to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic. This was a project that I had been looking forward to, having already planned out my ideas for it during the first week of class. To prevent these ideas from being lost, I decided to move forward with this project on my own in April. I used this idea to learn UI/UX design and how to use Adobe Xd.

                    Camp Zodiac is a fictional camping/lodging company that offers camping experiences based on four zodiac signs. These experiences are meant to be enjoyed by people of all ages, however, I targeted the website for those in their late 20s to mid 30s. My goal was for Camp Zodiac to come across as the best way for one to spend a vacation in nature.

                <h2 class="orange"> LEARNING UI/UX </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in UX design so I used this project to practice a few UX friendly ideas. I focused some research on finding various design techniques that help encourage a user flow and fluid navigation. The best example of this in my prototype is the visit page. On this page you are presented with four ‘camping experience’ options to learn more about. Once you tap on an option you are brought to a page that gives the user more information about the camping experience. From this page, you can either book an experience or you are able to swipe through the other camping options. I wanted to minimize the user from having to go back and forth between the main visit page and learning more info about each option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to create a complete booking process with this prototype - including a credit card form! Before creating my design, I researched about good UX practices for forms and utilized many of the practices that I saw including a multi-step form, proper spacing and labels, easy to understand error messages, and allowing for edits at every step.
