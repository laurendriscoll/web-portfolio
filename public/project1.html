                <h2 class="orange"> What Went Wrong </h2>
                <p>I created the original logo in Spring of 2020. It was my first graphic design project, and my first ever logo. Needless to say, my designs skills were pretty rough at the time and major flaws were bound to happen. When sketching out ideas for the logo I wanted to focus on my involvment with creating 3D models. At the time, that was the strongest skills I had. However, my skills and knowledge of creating 3D models was very basic and not nearly enough for me to score a job. Additionally, the time it takes to learn and develop those skills indepedently alongside college was not practical for me to make it my focus for a career. In the new design, I wanted to avoid that association and I wanted my logo to be flexible for the industry. Likewise, using 'interactive design' in the logo not only removed the flexibility of my logo, but it also created a pretty ugly abbreviation. I would bet most read it as "L-DID", and honestly I did not want to be remembered by that. </p>
                <p>The other issues with my original logo involved overall poor design and quality. The first noticable issue is that the logo uses extrememly thin strokes for the letters. This was a mistake that I could have easily fixed, but at the time I didn't really find it an issue. Now I know that scaling logos with thin lines can be a disaster and to always avoid using strokes in a logo when possible. Another issue that I had was poor kerning in some of the letters. This meant that some of the letters felt more spaced out than others and it made the text feel pretty messy. However, this wasn't the only messy area of the logo. Because the design itself is so complex, I was unable to join certain lines and there was a lot of overlapping of lines and shapes in certain areas. When you zoom in, you can see the messiness this created. Some areas it looks like a mistake and overall it ruins the quality of the design.</p>

                <h2 class="orange"> My Approach </h2>
                <p class="padded">When I decided to redesign my logo I knew that I wanted to change two things: shorten the abbreviation and use different colors. The reasoning behind the abbreviation is pretty obvious, but the original colors were chosen to represent red and blue for the '3D niche' that I no longer wanted to trap myself in. In the new design, I wanted to use colors that were more bold and creative. I felt that orange and indigo represented myself best.</p>
                <p class="padded">To the left of this next there is an image showing the iterations that I went through before settling on my final design. After I went through the first set of iterations I decided to show some family and friends to get their opinions on which stood out the most to them. I gathered the few designs they liked the most and created some further iterations based on the suggestions they had. I liked the final one I settled because both the 'L' and 'D' stood out even when the design is in black and white.</p>
                <p class="padded">Below is a style guide showing the final design in full color and black and white. The font I used to create the logo was Proxima Nova, however, I rounded out the corners of the letters to make the font less sharp. On this website I use the Google font, Fredoka One, which looks very similar to the rounded Proxima Nova. I also defined a light and dark variation of each color so that I could use text with appropriate contrast ratios on light and dark backgrounds. You will see these exact colors used throughout this website.</p>
